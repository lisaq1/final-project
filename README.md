## Medical Health in Tech

### The Summary:
With the fast paced expansion of the tech industry, there has been lots of speculation around the work environment in such a high stress industry. This puts mental heath as a major concern to employers and employees. In this report, the correlation between age, seeking help, and company offered care options are looked at first. Then we take another approach and look at what the relationship between age, medical leave, and the interference this leave has on work. Data neccessary to understand these correlations is primarily depicted through scatter plots and bar graphs. 

## The Data:
The data was found on Kaggle, an online data library, produced by OSMI (Open Source Mental Illness). The dataset is from a 2014 survey the organization conducted and it focuses on the attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. The primary respondents were regular employees in tech in various countries (mostly from the US).

### The Questions:
1. Is there a correlation between those who seek mental health and their age? And how do company care options play a role?
2. How easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition? Is there an age relatioinship with this?
