## Medical Health in Tech

### The Summary:
With the fast paced expansion of the tech industry, there has been lots of speculation around the work environment in such a high stress industry. This puts mental heath as a major concern to employers and employees. In this report, the correlation between age, seeking help, and company offered care options are looked at first. Then we take another approach and look at what the relationship between age, medical leave, and the interference this leave has on work. Data neccessary to understand these correlations is primarily depicted through scatter plots and bar graphs. 

In other words what this report addresses:
### The Questions:
1. Is there a correlation between those who seek mental health and their age? And how do company care options play a role?
2. How easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition? Is there an age relatioinship with this?
